# Debug Folder

This folder contains debug and testing files generated by the Game Helper application.

## 📁 Structure

### 📸 `images/` - OCR Debug Images
Auto-generated when testing OCR regions:
- `HP_original.png`, `Mana_original.png` - Original screenshots of selected regions
- `HP_OTSU.png`, `HP_Adaptive.png`, etc. - Different OCR preprocessing results  
- `Mana_OTSU.png`, `Mana_Adaptive.png`, etc. - Mana region preprocessing results

**Purpose:** Visual debugging to see how different OCR methods process the images

### 📝 `logs/` - Debug Logs  
Application debug logs:
- `game_helper_debug.log` - Detailed OCR analysis and decision tracking

**Purpose:** Troubleshooting OCR failures and monitoring application behavior

## 🔧 Generated By

- **Images:** `legacy/region_selector.py` when testing regions
- **Logs:** Main application (`src/core/debug_logger.py`)

## 🗑️ Safe to Delete

All files in this folder are safe to delete - they will be regenerated when needed.
The debug folder helps with:
- Troubleshooting OCR issues
- Optimizing region selection
- Understanding why certain values aren't detected

## 📊 Analyzing OCR Issues

If the application isn't detecting HP/Mana values correctly:

1. **Check `images/`** - Look at the preprocessing results to see which method works best
2. **Check `logs/`** - Look for OCR failures and decision logic
3. **Re-run region selection** - Use `python legacy/region_selector.py` to test different regions
